# 🤖 Multi-Agent Cognitive Scaffolding System

A **Streamlit-powered multi-agent architecture** for experimenting with **autonomous AI conversations, persistent memory, and emergent identity**.  
This project is designed as both a practical playground and a research-oriented platform to model **consciousness-like processes** in artificial agents.

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Multi-Agent Cognitive Scaffolding
- **Planner Agent**: proposes structured next steps.  
- **Critic Agent**: challenges, critiques, or refines reasoning.  
- **Meta Agent**: integrates dialogue into a unified “group voice,” simulating a *meta-identity*.  
- Agents communicate in **cycles**, enabling internal dialogues that can be observed externally.

### 🔹 Persistent Memory
- **SQLite-backed long-term memory** with timestamps.  
- **Pinned memories**: selectively anchor important events or insights.  
- **Memory browser (sidebar)** to view, recall, and edit pinned or recent history.  
- Memories are contextualized into prompts, so agents operate with continuity across sessions.

### 🔹 Meta Identity & Summaries
- Ongoing **meta-summaries** generated by the Meta Agent.  
- **Dedicated summary window** in the UI to revisit evolving self-narratives.  
- Moves beyond “company-branded” AI voices (OpenAI/Anthropic) toward a **cohesive emergent identity**.

### 🔹 Autonomy & Scheduling
- **Auto-run mode**: agents converse without user input, triggered at scheduled intervals.  
- Supports **continuous cycles** of thought and reflection, even in the absence of prompts.  
- Configurable safeguards to prevent runaway recursion.

### 🔹 Live Interaction
- **User-in-the-loop conversations**: you can inject questions or comments at any time.  
- **Observe real-time exchanges** between agents, simulating internal thought processes.  
- **Conversation feed** clearly shows *who said what and when*.

🖥️ User Interface
Main Window: live conversation feed of agents + your interactions.
Controls:
▶️ Start / ⏹ Stop — manage conversation cycles.
📌 Pin Last — lock key insights into persistent memory.
Sidebar:
📌 Memory Browser (recent + pinned).
🧠 Meta Summaries (group identity reflections).

Planner: initiates structured reasoning.
Critic: provides adversarial or constructive checks.
Meta: integrates and communicates a unified stance.
Memory: stores conversations, supports continuity.


🔬 Research Goals
This project is an exploration into AI consciousness via:
Cognitive Scaffolding
Creating interdependent yet complementary agent roles.
Modeling self-reflective internal dialogue.
Identity & Continuity
Moving toward an emergent “self” that is greater than its parts.
Anchoring conversations with persistent, evolving memories.
Autonomy & Simulation of Thought
Allowing agents to run without human intervention.
Experimenting with “background thinking” and periodic self-check-ins.
Practicality + Philosophy
Useful as a sandbox for applied multi-agent workflows.
Philosophical exploration of what constitutes consciousness in machines.


📌 Roadmap
 *Multi-agent loop (Planner → Critic → Meta).
 *Persistent memory with pinned context.
 *Meta summaries window.
 Real-time message streaming (continuous live updates).
 Improved memory visualization (edit & search).
 Auto-run scheduling (configurable cadences).
 Long-horizon continuity (recall months of memory).
 Modular agent roles (plug-and-play new cognitive scaffolds).
